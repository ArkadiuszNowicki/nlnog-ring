Puppet objectives

group ring-users' should exist on all nodes
group ring-admins' should exist on all nodes

all regular users should be in ring-users
peter, edwin, job, martin should be in group ring-admins

the owner should be in group admin

if a user does not exist on system the user should be created with --disabled-password

puppet should sync $username/.ssh from the master to all nodes automaticly if something changes

all servers should run in timezone "Europe/Amsterdam"

owners are responsible for maintaining a good clock on the machine, they can decide to use ntp or some virtualisation stuff to make the clock tick steady.

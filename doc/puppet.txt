Puppet objectives

This file contains random notes about how the installation should be

group ring-users' should exist on all nodes
group ring-admins' should exist on all nodes

all regular users should be in ring-users
peter, edwin, job, martin should be in group ring-admins

the owner should be in group admin

if a user does not exist on system the user should be created with --disabled-password

puppet will make sure 1 specific ssh key that a organisation gave us is always present 
in the authorized_keys, other ssh keys can be synced through a small shell script which 
loops through all the servers: for i in servers; do rsyncs ~/.ssh/*
$servers; done


all servers should run in timezone "Europe/Amsterdam"

owners are responsible for maintaining a good clock on the machine, they can decide to use ntp or some virtualisation stuff to make the clock tick steady. 

apt-get install unattended-upgrades && add the following line to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";

users should not be able to read each others files or homedirs, everything
700

NLNOG RING Project - User Guide

PROVISIONING A SERVER:
    
    Install ubuntu in accordance with the requirements. The user that is 
    created by the installation can be called 'nlnog'. After installation 
    you can add one of our public ssh keys to the 
    /home/nlnog/.ssh/authorized_keys file and email us the FQDN of the 
    machine and your ssh key.  The ring-admin will install puppet and 
    setup dns in the ring.nlnog.net zone. 

    PGP & SSH Keys are available at: http://ring.nlnog.net/

    After you have been notified that the server has been added to the ring
    and is under control of the puppetmaster, there are the following tasks
    you need to perform:

    - login with your assigned username & the ssh-key you gave us
    
    - change the root password to something extremely hard to guess with 
        "'passwd root". Keep in mind, only you will know this password, 
        it is meant to be used only in emergencies. 
        
    - If you don't change the password the user root cannot login.
        
    - add additional ssh keys to your authorized_keys and run the 
        'ring-sync-ssh-keys' script to rsync the authorized_keys file from
        your machine to all others. This way you can give co-workers access
        to the ring.

USING THE RING:

    - a lot of utilities are available to you, see the
        doc/install_packages.txt file for a full list. If you need a package
        please email admins@ring.nlnog.net with your request. Generally we
        only install packages available to a stock ubuntu 10.04 LTS install.

    - Never use passwords on the ring, only use ssh-keys. 

    - There are some custom ring scripts available to you to execute
      commands on all or a subset of the servers.
            $ document here all scripts we want to create

NLNOG RING Project - User Guide

PROVISIONING A SERVER:
    
    Install ubuntu in accordance on a machine that complies with our
    requirements, email credentials to the machine to one of the
    ring-admins (pgp encrypted). The ring-admin will install puppet and
    setup dns in the ring.nlnog.net zone. 

    After you have been notified that the server has been added to the ring
    and is under control of the puppetmaster, there are the following tasks
    you need to perform:

        - login with your assigned username & the ssh-key you gave us
    
        - change the root password to something 'passwd root'
            Only you will know this password, it meant to be used in
            emergencies. 
        
        - If you don't change the password the user root cannot login.
        
        - add additional ssh keys to your authorized_keys and run the
            'ring-sync-ssh-keys' script to rsync the authorized_keys file
            from your machine to all others. This way you can give
            co-workers access to the ring.

USING THE RING:

    - a lot of utilities are available to you, see the
      doc/install_packages.txt file for a full list. If you need a package
      please email admins@ring.nlnog.net with your request. Generally we
      only install packages available to a stock ubuntu 10.04 LTS install.

    - Never use passwords on the ring, only use ssh-keys. 

    - There are some custom ring scripts available to you to execute
      commands on all or a subset of the servers.
            $ document here all scripts we want to create

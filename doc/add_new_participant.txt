Dear COMPANY_NAME 

The machine you provided is part of the ring now! 

The following information is vital: 

    - Your company's username is "OWNER_NAME"
    - The user "OWNER_NAME" has sudo rights on NODE_NAME (please don't break puppet :-)

If you want to add additional ssh keys, place them on NODE_NAME in /home/OWNER_NAME/sshkeys file and notify one of the ring-admins. One of the ring-admins will then import the sshkeys file into the configuration management system.
For further instruction on how to use the ring, see: https://ring.nlnog.net/user-guide/

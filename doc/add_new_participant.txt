Dear <Company name>,

The machine your provided is part of the ring now! 

The following information is vital: 

    - Your company's username is "<ownername>" 
    - The user "<ownername>" has sudo rights on <node> (please don't break puppet :-)

If you want to add additional ssh keys, place them on <node> in /home/<ownername>/sshkeys file and notify one of the ring-admins. One of the ring-admins will then import the sshkeys file into the configuration management system.

You are welcome to join the ring-users mailinglist, which is used for announcements and discussions among RING users. You can find the list at http://mailman.ring.nlnog.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ring-users

Kind regards,

<You>

Host *.ring.nlnog.net
ForwardAgent yes
User <ownername>
IdentityFile /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa_nlnogring

Priority 1:
  - Figure out how to deal with a world without sudo and still make programs like 
    tcpdump (http://seclists.org/tcpdump/2010/q2/30) work. 
  - Delegation of ring.nlnog.net
  - Setup mailinglist for all participants
  - add ipv6 addresses to /etc/hosts
  - switch from webrick to passanger for puppet

Priority 2:
  - Setup smokeping master/slave between all participants
  - compile list of essential packages: tcpdump, build-essential, mtr,
    dnsutils, traceroute
  - setup smtp.ring.nlnog.net which will relay for all ring servers (cron emails etc)

Priority 3:
  - fix standard MOTD stating information like the the hostname, 
    owner/admin and ASN
  - logging of all commands, maybe use http://freshmeat.net/projects/snoopy_logger/

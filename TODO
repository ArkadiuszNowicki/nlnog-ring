Priority 1:
  - Figure out how to deal with a world without sudo and still make programs like 
    tcpdump (http://seclists.org/tcpdump/2010/q2/30) work. 
  - Setup mailinglist for all participants
  - switch from webrick to passanger for puppet
  - setup ring .deb repo

Priority 2:
  - setup smtp.ring.nlnog.net which will relay for all ring servers (cron emails etc)
  - modify ping, traceroute and mtr so they can run without sudo with ICMP
    traceroute and subsecond mtr stuff

Priority 3:
  - fix standard MOTD stating information like the the hostname, 
    owner/admin and ASN
  - logging of all commands, maybe use http://freshmeat.net/projects/snoopy_logger
  - setup up proper ssh host key distribution through puppet

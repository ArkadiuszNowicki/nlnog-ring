Priority 1:

    - modify ping, traceroute so they can run without sudo with ICMP
      traceroute  (peter)
    - figure out how to deal with email (central smtp.ring.nlnog.net?) 

Priority 2:

    - push mail configuration so root@ on a machien is forwarded to ring-admins
      and the owner
    - improve ssh key distribution (fetch keys from all nodes, merge, and
      push back) (martin)
    - switch from webrick to passanger for puppet (job - when master becomes
      to slow)
    - whitelist all ip addresses of ring-nodes and ring-admins in fail2ban
      ssh blocker

Priority 3:
 
    - fix standard MOTD stating information like the the hostname, 
    owner/admin and ASN
    - logging of all commands, maybe use http://freshmeat.net/projects/snoopy_logger
    - setup up proper ssh host key distribution through puppet 

Priority 4:

    - add owner to group 'admin' through puppet (hard task - manually is easy
    and only once)

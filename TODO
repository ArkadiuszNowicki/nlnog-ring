Priority 1:

    - modify ping, traceroute so they can run without sudo with ICMP
      traceroute  (peter)
    - figure out how to deal with email (central smtp.ring.nlnog.net?)
    - improve ssh user key distribution (fetch keys from all nodes, merge, and
      push back) (martin)
            - make fact who is the admin of the machine
            - retrieve ~$admin/.ssh/authorized_keys from the homemachine
                -> distribute to all other ringnodes
Priority 2:

    - push mail configuration so root@ on a machine is forwarded to ring-admins
      and the owner
   - switch from webrick to passanger for puppet (job - when master becomes
      to slow)
    - whitelist all ip addresses of ring-nodes and ring-admins in fail2ban
      ssh blocker
    - feature: ./ring-lb-test $node1 $node2
        this will start a udp listener on node2 and send 10 packets from
        node1 to node2:port, if some packets consistently do not arrive
        maybe something funky is going on somewhere in an etherchannel

Priority 3:
 
    - fix standard MOTD stating information like the the hostname, 
    owner/admin and ASN
    - logging of all commands, maybe use http://freshmeat.net/projects/snoopy_logger
    - setup up proper ssh host key distribution through puppet
    - monitoring (nagios?) 

Priority 4:

    - add owner to group 'admin' through puppet (hard task - manually is easy
    and only once)
